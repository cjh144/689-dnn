This is the project for CSCE689-Advanced Topics of Deep Learning.
The objective of this project is to identify human limping.

For now, the model is trained based on Walking Gait Dataset which could be found at http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~labimage/GaitDataset/
The dataset is stored in /skeleton/

In this version, the model used for front/back view is /models/front-slow/model.h5
The model used for side-view identification is /models/side-rotate/model.h5

test.py will show the test result in test dataset.

video prediction:
First run OpenPose for the target video, and put json file in a directory.
Then enter the path of this directory and the model used in the main function in video_pred.py and run this script.

It will generate the prediction figure, time label json file and a animation which shows the video, skeleton and prediction result.
