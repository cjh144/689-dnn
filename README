This is the project for CSCE689-Advanced Topics of Deep Learning.
The objective of this project is to identify human limping.

For now, the model is trained based on Walking Gait Dataset which could be found at http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~labimage/GaitDataset/

The final model is models/400.h5
The code to load this model and run prediction is in predict.py
